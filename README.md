<h1> Javascript </h1>

Javascript is invented by Brendan Eich who first developed Netscape-2 !
Javascript first developed for firefox but later on it is accepted by mostly every browser!

Everything in the Javascript is happened inside an "Execution Context"

Execution Context contains 2 things <strong> Memory (variable Environment) </strong> and <strong> Code (Thread of execution) </strong>
