Tailwind CSS is referred to as a "utility-first" framework because of its unique approach to building user interfaces. In traditional CSS frameworks, you typically work with pre-defined components and classes that encapsulate specific styles and functionality. However, Tailwind CSS takes a different approach.

In Tailwind CSS, instead of providing pre-defined components, the framework focuses on providing a comprehensive set of utility classes that can be combined and applied directly to HTML elements. These utility classes represent individual CSS properties and can be used to quickly style elements by adding classes to the markup.

For example, instead of having a pre-defined button component with a specific style, you can use Tailwind's utility classes to build a button by combining various classes like `bg-blue-500`, `text-white`, `p-2`, `rounded`, etc. Each class represents a specific utility, such as background color, text color, padding, or border radius.

This utility-first approach allows developers to have fine-grained control over the styles applied to elements, making it highly customizable and flexible. It eliminates the need for writing custom CSS for every new component or style variation, resulting in a more efficient and streamlined development process.

By providing a comprehensive set of utility classes, Tailwind CSS empowers developers to rapidly build UIs by composing and reusing existing styles. It promotes a declarative and component-centric development workflow, where you can focus on writing HTML and applying utility classes rather than dealing with custom CSS.
