<h1>Distinction between React.JS and Next.JS and what is the need to use Next.JS</h1>

<h2>Rendering</h2>

There are two types of rendering which are client-side rendering and server-side rendering. React.JS performs UI rendering on client-side and Next.JS performs server-side rendering but it provides flexibilty in rendering as we can decide that UI renders on client-side or server-side as per our need.


<h3>What is client-side rendering and server-side rendering and which is better</h3>

Client-side rendering happens on client's device when user requests a web page to server and then server respond as it sent back the HTML document and JavaScript code to client and browser executes that web page.

Server-side rendering renders the components on server side itself and then sent back the fully renered HTML document and web page to client which results in immediet reponse. This highlights important aspect of Web Development "SEO" (Search Engine Optimization).

<h1>SEO</h1>

Search Engine Optimization crawlers find difficulties indexing pages dynamically rendered on the client-side as result, the SEO performance of such pages may suffer as search engine may not fully comprehend their content and not rank them approprietly.
