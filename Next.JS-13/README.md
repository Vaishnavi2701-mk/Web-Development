<h1>Distinction between React.JS and Next.JS and what is the need to use Next.JS</h1>

<h2>Rendering</h2>

There are two types of rendering which are client-side rendering and server-side rendering. React.JS performs UI rendering on client-side and Next.JS performs server-side rendering but it provides flexibilty in rendering as we can decide that UI renders on client-side or server-side as per our need.
