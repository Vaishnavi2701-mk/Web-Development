<h1> SASS </h1>

SASS - Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet.<br>
SASS is an extention of CSS which increases the ability and features of CSS than any other CSS extension.<br>
We cannot directly link SASS into HTML as CSS; we have to process SASS in CSS with the help of task runner like GULP.<br>
We can create our own CSS liabrary like Bootstrap, Tailwind and use it in our personal projects by customizing it.<br>
The extension it uses is .scss or .sass but they use quite different syntax.<br>
Sass is a stylesheet language thatâ€™s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.<br>
