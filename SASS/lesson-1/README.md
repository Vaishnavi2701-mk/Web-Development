<h1> SASS </h1>

SASS - Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet.<br>

SASS is an extention of CSS which increases the ability and features of CSS than any other CSS extension.<br>

We cannot directly link SASS into HTML as CSS; we have to process SASS in CSS with the help of task runner like GULP.<br>

We can create our own CSS liabrary like Bootstrap, Tailwind and use it in our personal projects by customizing it.<br>

The extension it uses is .scss or .sass but they use quite different syntax.<br>

Sass is a stylesheet language thatâ€™s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.<br>

Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a CSS preprocessor that gives your CSS superpowers.</br>

Let's face it: writing CSS can be difficult at times, especially in today's world of increasingly complex user interfaces.</br>

And many times, you'll find that you're repeating yourself often.</br>

Sass comes to the rescue in this situation. It helps you stick to the DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself) philosophy when writing CSS.</br>

Sass provides a compiler that allows us to write stylesheets in two different syntaxes, indented and SCSS. Let's look at each now.</br>
