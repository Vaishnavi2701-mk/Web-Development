<h1> SASS </h1>

SASS - Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet.<br>
SASS is an extention of CSS which increases the ability and features of CSS than any other CSS extension.<br>
We cannot directly link SASS into HTML as CSS; we have to process SASS in CSS with the help of task runner like GULP.<br>
We can create our own CSS liabrary like Bootstrap, Tailwind and use it in our personal projects by customizing it.<br>
The extension it uses is .scss or .sass but they use quite different syntax.<br>
