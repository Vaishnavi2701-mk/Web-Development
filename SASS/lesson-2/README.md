<h1> STEPS </h1>

1. Save file as .scss instead of css. <br>
2. We cannot compile SASS inside CSS; we have to install an extension "Live SASS compiler". <br>
3. But it doesn't provide that much functionalities. <br>
4. Install gulp for that. <br>
5. To install gulp we need npm and for that we need node.js. <br>
6. Check if node.js installed by node -v. <br>
7. npm init. <br>
8. npm install gulp gulp-sass sass --save-dev. <br>
